# Dynamic-WebPage
A To-Do List dynamic webpage is an interactive web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks in real-time. It typically uses HTML and CSS for layout and design, and JavaScript for handling user interactions, such as marking tasks as complete or saving them in local storage.
